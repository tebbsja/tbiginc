HOW TO USE THE IMAGE EDITOR JAVA PROGRAM TO HELP YOU TEST YOUR IMAGE EDITOR

1. Open the jar file via the command line or by double clicking on it.
2. Select where your .java files are located
	**Please note that this means only the ones you coded.
3. Click copy to allow the program to copy the files into a directory it can access.
4. Click Compile to compile the program to run inside of the program.
5. Select a PPM file for the PPM File Location
6. Select a destination for the output file once it is converted.
7. Select one of the buttons on the bottom to convert your image to that.
	**Motion blur you can change
	
Names of the output file
**********************
invert: invertOutput.ppm
grayscale: grayscaleOutput.ppm
emboss: embossOutput.ppm
MotionBlur: motionBlurOutput.ppm
**********************

Please note that this code is not meant to debug but, to help you look at the output of your
program. This will simply allow you to look at the output ppm file with a text editor on 
your computer. If you have any issues with it, please feel free to tell Spencer (The TA) about it.
He will try his best to squash any bugs that you run into or, implement any good suggestions. If a 
suggestion you give is included and you are the first to tell him, he will probably give you a
shout-out in the Guide.txt unless you wish to remain annoymous.

Remember, this is just a side project of Spencers and not offically supported by the class. That means,
if this program does not work for you, you will still have to finish the project by the due date.

Release 1.0
	First Release of the Program.
